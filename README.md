# Persona 5 Themed Portfolio

A highly stylized personal portfolio website heavily inspired by the UI and aesthetics of **Persona 5**
## Highlights

- **Persona 5 UI/UX Aesthetics**: Features custom "wiggle polygon" animations, dynamic text strokes, and the iconic red, black, white, and cyan color palette.
- **Immersive Experience**: Runs a continuous ambient background video (`main1.mp4`) and features a persistent, toggleable Background Music (BGM) player with volume control.
- **Authentic SFX**: UI interactions, such as navigating menus or entering pages, trigger authentic sound effects (`select.mp3`).
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Fully supports traversing the main menu and certain overlays using keyboard arrow keys and `Enter/Escape`, mimicking the actual game controls.
- **Custom Page Transitions**: Smooth, multi-layered "stripe" transition animations when navigating between routes.
